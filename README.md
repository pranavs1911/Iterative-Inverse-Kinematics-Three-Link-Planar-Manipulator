# Inverse Kinematics-Three-Link-Planar-Manipulator
Implemented a simple inverse kinematics algorithm for a planar three link manipulator. The inverse kinematics solution of the planner was formulated using a recursive solution. 

The skeleton code for the the script was provided by Ariana Eisenstein from the Pickle Robot Company (Boston, MA). The script had to be updated to make sure the planner works well.

The below picture shows the success of the motion planning algorithm. A random point (X,Y) is generated in the workspace and the three link planar manipulator reaches the point with a tolerance of 0.01 and makes sure the algorithm adheres to the constraints.
