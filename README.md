# Motion-Planner-Three-Link-Planar-Manipulator-
Implemented a simple motion planner for a planar three link manipulator. The inverse kinematics solution of the planner was formulated using a recursive solution. 

The skeleton code for the the script was provided by Ariana Eisenstein from the Pickle Robot Company. The script had to be updated to make sure the planner works well.
