# Inverse Kinematics-Three-Link-Planar-Manipulator
Implemented a simple inverse kinematics algorithm for a planar three link manipulator. The inverse kinematics was formulated using a recursive method which checks whether the configuration of the three link planar manipulator is valid for a particular pose of the end effector. 

The skeleton code for the the script was provided by Ariana Eisenstein from the Pickle Robot Company (Boston, MA). The script had to be updated to make sure the algorithm works well.

The below picture shows the success of the inv-kin algorithm. A random point (X,Y) is generated in the workspace and the three link planar manipulator reaches the point with a tolerance of 0.01.
